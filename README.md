Using this project I keep the status of my current knowledge of SQL.

Steps of implementation:

In order to create the database schema model I have installed and configured MySQL Workbench and 'MySQL Server' version 8.0.36 on Port: 3306.

As Users I have defined:
1.  VersionDataManager with the role 'Backup Admin',
2.  Alex with role 'Process Admin',
3. UsersAdministrator with role 'User Admin'.

I have created DB HighSchool with the following tables: Class, Stundent and Professor.
